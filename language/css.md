# CSS

> [Getting started with CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started)

## Intro
How it works
* The browser converts the markup language and the CSS into the *DOM*.

*Cascading* Style Sheets
* Browser's default styles
* Styles specified by the user
* Styles linked to the document by the author
  * external
  * def at the begining: used for styles only used on that page
  * on an element in the body: can be used for testing


## [Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Selectors)

### Basics
```
selector { 
  //declaration inside
  property: value;
}
```
* Class selectors
* ID selectors


* Attribute selectors
  * use square brackets and put attr name inside
  * optionally followed by a matching operator and a value
  * `i` indicates it's case-insensitive (not fully supported by browsers)

```css
[diabled] [type='button']
[class~=key] /* one of the classes is exactly key (same as .key) */
[lang|=es] /* exactly or starts with es- */
[title*="example"] /* includes as a substring */
a[href^="https://"] /* starts with */
img[src$=".png"] /* ends with */
```
> More on [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors).

* Pseudo-classes selectors
  * `:hover`, `:focus`, `:visited`,`:nth-child`, `:checked`, etc.

### Precedence

Conflicting rules

1. more specific (eg. #id > .class/pseudo-classes/attribute > tag/pseudo-element)
2. equally specific: later in the stylesheet

### Selectors based on relationships

Rules applied to `E`

* `A E` - descendant
  * Note that `A, E` does not represent any relationship, just applying the same rules to them (Grouped selectors)
* `A > E` - direct descendant
* `E:first-child` - first child of its parent
* `B + E` - next sibling of B (next child of the same parent)


## [Text styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Text_styles)

> Use [`font`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) to set several properties at once (but I think it's not very readable)

* `font-family`
* `font-size`
* `line-height`
* `text-decoration`
* `font-style`
* `font-weight`
* `font-variant`
* Turn off: `normal` or `inherit`

## [Color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Color)

* use keywords
* `#red-green-blue`
  * `#fff` white
  * `#000` black
* `#ff0000` (= `#0f0`)
* `rgb(128, 0, 0)` - decimal RGB values ranging from 0 - 255


## [Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Content)

**Text content**

Add `::before` or `::after` to the selector to insert text content before or after an element. [DEMO](http://codepen.io/weicliu/pen/GZvRLL)

**Image content**

Specify the URL of an image file in the value of the [content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) property.

```css
/* This rule adds a space and an icon after every link that has the class glossary */
a.glossary:after {content: " " url("../images/glossary-icon.gif");}
```

Use `backgroud: url("...")` to add an image as an element's background.

## [Lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Lists)

**Unordered lists**

`list-style: disc/circle/square`

**ordered list**

`list-style: decimal/lower,upper-roman/lower,upper-latin`

## [Boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Boxes)

**Color**

* color(padding) === color(element's background)
* color(margin) === transparent

**border**

* set to `none` or `hidden` to remove

**width**

* one: all around
* two: (top & bottom, left & right)
* four: (top, right, bottom, left)

## [Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Layout)

**Size unit**

* better to use a percentage or em
* em: size of the current font (the width of a letter m)

**Text layout**

* `text-align: left/right/center/justify`
* `text-indent`

**Floats**

* [`float`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) forces an element to the left or right until it touches the edge of its container *or another floated element*.

<img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/4927/=floats.png" width="300">

**Clearing floats**

* If the text is not long enough, use **`clear`** property to align, say a new heading, to the left instead of making it between the red boxes.
* Another way if there are problems with the `clear` (eg. the heading has siblings the should also float): use `overflow: hiddle` to the parent element to cause it to expand to contain them.

**Positioning**

> These are advanced properties. It is possible to use them in simple waysâ€”that is why they are mentioned in this basic tutorial. But using them for complex layouts can be difficult.

* `relative`: shifted *relative to its normal position*. Sometimes can also be achieved by `margin`
* `fixed`: relative to the document window
* `absolute`: fixed relative to a parent element (Only a parent that is itself positioned with relative, fixed or absolute will do)
* `static`: default. use this value to turn positiong off.

## [tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Tables)

* See you later :)


## [media](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_Started/Media)

Present a document differently in different media (eg. screen, print, projection, all).

**User interfaces**

For devices that support a UI.

* `E:hover`
* `E:focus` (keyboard focus)
* `E:active` (involved in the current user action)
* `E:link` (link not visited recently)
* `E:visited`

**`Curser` property**

* `pointer` (indicating a link. can be used for an element that is a link without using `<a>`)
* `wait` (cannot accept input)
* `progress` (is working, but can still accept input)
* `default`

**`outline`**

Use to indicate keyboard focus. Similar to `border`, but cannot specify individual sides.

```
:link:hover { outline: 1px solid #000; }
```

**use attribute**

* `disable` or `readonly`
* selector: `.green-button[disabled] `
